# Workforce Database

## Description
This application is a database that allows business owners to view and manage the department, roles and employees of their company.  When starting the application, the user is prompted with a menu with options to add new roles, employees and departments.  They are also able to update pre-exisitng roles and employees.  Upon selecting new role or employee, the user is able to enter information through a series of prompts.  When finished, the data is added to the existing database.  The user is able to view all departments, role and employees.  Building this application allowed me to apply my learned knowledge using mySQL to create a functional database.  It also allowed me to continue practicing express.js, CRUD and write functions and using middleware.
